CURRENTLY IN PRE-PRE-ALPHA, DELAYED BY 2 YEARS (Expected release, 2037)
                    ~ THE OASIS ~
             (a ridiculously long-term VR project)

📅 **Status:** Pre-pre-pre-alpha. Empty. WIP.  
📆 **ETA:** 2035+ maybe. Great things take time.  
🎯 **Goal:** Build a true metaverse like *Ready Player One*'s Oasis.

---

## 🧠 Vision

TheOasis is not just a game.  
It’s an evolving, open virtual universe with zero paywalls and infinite potential —  
built **for everyone**, not just high-end PC chads.

> Powered by madness. Fueled by dreams.  
> Will probably run on toasters someday.

---

## 🔧 Current Features

- Placeholder code.
- Empty spaces with ambition.
- Roadmap, but on a napkin.

> ⚠️ **This project is NOT functional yet. (Might not even have started)**  
> But if you're reading this, you're early. You're based. You're awesome.

---

## 📱 Accessibility Goals

- Designed to run on:
  - Low-end PCs  
  - Budget laptops  
  - Mobile phones used as VR headsets (yes, fr)
- If it can run *Doom*, it should run Oasis. Eventually.

---

## 🚀 Future Goals

- Full VR + desktop support  
- Player-driven economies  
- Custom avatars, spaces, worlds  
- Open-source modding  
- Lore, memes, chaos

## 🛸 Final Notes

> This isn’t a Silicon Valley sprint.  
> It’s a hobbit-level journey to Mordor in VRChat sandals.
